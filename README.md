# goChat

This application was built for the purpose of better learning the GO programming language. Not only did this project help me better understand the language, but it allowed me to explore areas such as concurrency, network programming, and encryption. 

## How to use this program

First you must build the two binaries:
`go build client/chatClient.go`
`go build server/chatServer.go`

Following this you must start the server, followed by as many instances of the client as you wish.
